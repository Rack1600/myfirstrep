# My Repo 

Welcome to my repo!  What is this for?  Well, it's probably just a trashcan for stuff I need to save somewhere. 
Let's start with my .bashrc. Damn, why didn't I do this before.  Every job or new PC I start again.  There's always work specific stuff, but a lot of the same:
 - Git tools
 - Git aliases. 
 - Bash Aliases.
 - Bash scripts

Anyway enough about me. Let's get to it.
